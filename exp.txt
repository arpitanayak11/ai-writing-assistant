1. Introduction (30 sec – 1 min)
“This project is called an AI Writing Assistant. It’s a full-stack web app I built using React for the frontend, Node.js and Express for the backend, and I used the Cohere API to handle grammar correction, spell checking, and sentence rephrasing.
It’s designed to help users improve their writing in real time — similar to tools like Grammarly, but built from scratch.”

2. Why I Built It (1 min)
“The idea came from my own writing struggles — sometimes I would second-guess grammar or spelling, and I wanted something that could help quickly.
Instead of relying on browser extensions or external editors, I thought — why not build my own version with real AI behind it?”

3. Tech Stack Overview (1–2 mins)
Frontend: Built with React, and styled using Tailwind CSS for responsiveness and a clean UI.

Backend: Created using Express.js. I exposed 3 routes: one for grammar check, one for spell check, and one for sentence rephrasing.

API: Integrated the Cohere AI API — it’s an NLP model that takes prompts and returns intelligent completions.

Auth: I used Privy for secure authentication — though in this version, it’s more about preparing for future private user sessions.

4. How It Works (3–4 mins)
On the homepage, the user types any paragraph or sentence.

The app lets them click on three options:

✅ Check Grammar

✅ Check Spelling

✅ Rephrase

When a button is clicked, it sends the input to the backend via axios POST requests.

The backend formats a prompt and calls Cohere’s generate endpoint, then parses the response and sends it back.

The frontend displays the corrected or rephrased result, and the user can optionally click “Accept” to save it to a Corrected Sentences panel.

I also added a feature where users can select individual sentences, and rephrase just that sentence instead of the entire paragraph.

5. Key Features I’m Proud Of (1–2 mins)
The backend responses were tricky — Cohere sometimes returns extra quotes or newline characters. I fixed that using a small regex filter.

I designed the layout with Tailwind utility classes to be responsive and clean — usable on desktop or mobile.

I kept the code modular — reusable <Button /> and <ResultSection /> components.

6. What I Learned (2 mins)
I learned how to integrate AI APIs in real-world apps — especially prompt engineering.

Improved my understanding of frontend-backend communication, handling asynchronous API calls, and securing routes using headers.

I also got better at debugging, especially figuring out why certain buttons weren’t returning results — like handling different response formats, CORS issues, and proper request bodies.

7. Future Improvements (1–2 mins)
I plan to add login + MongoDB to save each user's corrections.

I’d like to let users download corrected output or copy to clipboard easily.

I may even add tone detection or suggest improvements in formal, casual, or professional writing style.

8. Conclusion (30 sec)
“Overall, this project helped me connect frontend, backend, and AI in a real-world use case.
It’s not just a portfolio piece — I use it personally now, and I’m excited to expand it further.”
